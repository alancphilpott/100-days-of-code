**Todays Progress**: Began creating a todo app, finished its layout and can create todos.

**Thoughts**

-   Introduced to the DOM for the first time. Nothing too complicated, yet.
-   Differece between a HTML Collection and NodeList when obtaining HTML elements through JS.
-   How to create Events and handle Event Bubbling.
-   Dynamically add HTML elements using JS.
-   Working with Google Fonts API and Font Awesome Icons.
-   Using Emmet Shortcuts

**Todays Progress**: Continuing todo app, added complete and delete todo functionality.

**Thoughts**

-   Learnt how to toggle CSS classes from within JavaScript.
-   Improving at working with Parent-Child elements in JS.
-   Creating animation effects when an event occurs.
-   Working with and styling the select HTML elememt.
-   Realisation that CSS class naming is important to prevent errors.

### Day 52: June 7, 2020

**Todays Progress**: Completed todo app. Fixed filtering todos errors. Todos now save to the browsers local storage. Added favicon. Project hosted using GitHub Pages service (see link to work below).

**Thoughts**

-   Difference between local and session storage.
-   Used stackoverflow to find out a CSS property related to Mozilla called "-moz-focusring".
-   Deleting items from local storage can be tricky. Used alternative method than suggested from the course called Arrray.filter().

There is definitely more work that can be done to this app such as when refreshing the page, the todos marked as completed, stay marked as completed. That would require some manipulation of the data when saving to the browsers local storage. Will come back to this at a later date.
