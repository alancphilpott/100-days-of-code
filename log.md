### Day 11 to 22 Microverse

[About](https://www.microverse.org/) Microverse
I was successful in the Microverse application process and became a student for 2 weeks. My goal was to improve my collaboration and peer-programming skills. After 2 weeks in I realised that the course was not for me and I could also feel that Microverse was still in its early stages with cracks yet to be ironed out. I provided useful feedback to the company and parted ways. Still met some great people.

## Daily Log Update Begins Here

### Day 50: June 5, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Began creating a todo app, finished its layout and can create todos.

**Thoughts**

-   Introduced to the DOM for the first time. Nothing too complicated, yet.
-   Differece between a HTML Collection and NodeList when obtaining HTML elements through JS.
-   How to create Events and handle Event Bubbling.
-   Dynamically add HTML elements using JS.
-   Working with Google Fonts API and Font Awesome Icons.
-   Using Emmet Shortcuts

**Useful Resources**

### Day 51: June 6, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Continuing todo app, added complete and delete todo functionality.

**Thoughts**

-   Learnt how to toggle CSS classes from within JavaScript.
-   Improving at working with Parent-Child elements in JS.
-   Creating animation effects when an event occurs.
-   Working with and styling the select HTML elememt.
-   Realisation that CSS class naming is important to prevent errors.

### Day 52: June 7, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Completed todo app. Fixed filtering todos errors. Todos now save to the browsers local storage. Added favicon. Project hosted using GitHub Pages service (see link to work below).

**Thoughts**

-   Difference between local and session storage.
-   Used stackoverflow to find out a CSS property related to Mozilla called "-moz-focusring".
-   Deleting items from local storage can be tricky. Used alternative method than suggested from the course called Arrray.filter().

There is definitely more work that can be done to this app such as when refreshing the page, the todos marked as completed, stay marked as completed. That would require some manipulation of the data when saving to the browsers local storage. Will come back to this at a later date.

### Day 53: June 8, 2020

eCollege JavaScript [Course](https://www.fetchcourses.ie/course/finder?sfcw-courseId=228121)

**Todays Progress**: Continuing with the eCollege JavaScript course requires me to go back over a lot of the basics as the later parts of the course are not accessible until they are complete. Nothing challenging today.

**Thoughts**

The course consists of 5 topics to cover. Each topic requiring about 2 weeks of study for someone new to programming. I finished the first topic today and noted the most important areas for this topic. Topic 1 teaches Operators, Methods and Keywords.

-   Be aware of the reserve keywords, e.g. Document, Debugger, Finally, Try, Console, Window, Catch, Log, Screen.
-   Know the symbols for basic math, especially the modulas operator. It can have it's own entier exam topic.
-   How to use compound assignment operators.
-   Increment and Decremenet prefix and postfix.
-   Best practices: comments, indentations, naming conventions, debugging tools.
-   Using inline and external scripts, including precendence rules.
-   Try, Catch and Finally.
-   Differences between alert, confirm, and prompty dialogs.
-   How to retrieve screen size, important for responsive design.

### Day 54: June 9, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Started working on Chapter 4 of Ed's Creative JavaScript course. This chapter focuses on working with Arrays, of which I am very familiar with already, but getting a unique perspective based on his teaching methods is still a valuable case.

**Thoughts**

I made it through 7/10 topics with Chapter 4: Arrays. The areas covered were:

-   Primitives and Reference Data Types - great refresher on something easily overlooked by programmers.
-   Higher Order Functions and Callbacks - very valuable information, especially since JS is highly event-driven.
-   Array.map()
-   Array.find()
-   Array.filter()
-   Array.some() and Array.every() - was my first time using these methods, will definitely use in future.
-   Ternary Operator - the only conditional operator to have 3 operands and something no developer can do without.

I am committing this work to GitHub but to a private repository.

### Skipped June 10, 2020 - Too unwell.

### Day 55: June 11, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Finished of Chatper 4 of Ed's Creative JavaScript Course.

**Thoughts**

I made it through the final 3 topics of Chapter 4: Arrays. The areas covered were:

-   Arrow Functions: a great compact alternative to regular function expressions. If the function has one statement within it, the curly brackets can be removed and the statement result is automatically returned.
-   Array Sorting: Calling sort() without any arguments will sort Strings, but to sort Numbers, the optional compareFunction arguments can be passed in, sort(firstEl, secondEl).
-   Spread Syntax: Something I'd seen before maybe once or twice, used to create a clone of Arrays/Objects which as a result will not affect the original reference data.

I am committing this work to GitHub but to a private repository.

### Day 56: June 12, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Finished of Chatper 5 of Ed's Creative JavaScript Course. This chapter was on Objects and covered many important topics.

**Thoughts**
Having a larger exposure to Java for the last number of years, the topic of Objects was nothing new to me, but within JavaScript there is a number of ways to create Objects.

-   Global Execution Context: Quick look into the compilation and execution phase. The compilation phase creates the default objects such as window in the browser and global within Node. Hoisting is also performed here, where functions and var declarations are stored in memory.
-   Callstack: The compile phase creates the Scope Chain determining what is accessible and where. When a function is called, a new execution context is created and added to the callstack. Once the function finishes executing, it is popped from the callstack and the execution context continues.
-   This Keyword: A pointer which references an object. This will be the window/global object by default. Using inside of an object method will reference the object itself.
-   Bind, Call, Apply: Functions are a type of Object. Allows setting of the this keyword to reference any object.
-   Constructor Functions: Used to instatiate an object using optional parameters.
-   Prototype: An object which every new object references. Used to add methods to an object to prevent duping of logic within each instance of an object.
-   Prototypal Inheritance: Copying/Inheriting functionality from another constructor. Allows creation of more specific types of an object.
-   Classes: Blueprints used for the creation of objects.

I am committing this work to GitHub but to a private repository.

### Day 57: June 13, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Finished the beatmaker project of Ed's Creative JavaScript Course.

**Thoughts**
I coded along with the tutorial videos but tomorrow I will add some more beats and functionality to the app to solidify my understanding of its creation. During this process I am sure to come up with another app I could create using similar knowledge.

-   Defining a class and creating an object.
-   Adding methods to the object to update/control props.
-   Functionality includes: selecting "pads" to play sounds on, choosing different sounds, play and pause feature, mute tracks and tempo slider.

### Day 58: June 14, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Updated the beatmaker project by adding additional tracks and sounds.

**Thoughts**
Adding the additional tracks and sounds was a straight forward process. While updating it it made it more clear how the application was working and I would be comfortable making this again in the future.

### Day 59: June 15, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Began a new project called Coolors which is a random color palette generator app. So far have created the page layout and styled most of it. The page currently generates a random color palette on load. Functionality still needs to be added to the page controls.

**Thoughts**
Today extra focus was given to how the HTML page was being setup in terms of it being ready to style with CSS. Any CSS property which I was unsure of, I read over its description and examples on MDN. Some examples included refreshing my knowledge of the position property as well as transition, overflow, border-radius, and how to determine the containing block, as the size and position of an element is often impacted by its containing block.

This project will include the use of an external javascript library known as ChromaJS. This is a library to handle to complexities of working with colors, in terms of color conversions and color scales.

When accesing the children of a div or selected element, it's important to know the different between the childNodes property and the children property as one returns a Node List and one a HTML Collection.

**Link to Work**: The work for this will be linked once complete, check later days in the log.

### Day 60: June 16, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Continuing with the Coolors project, adding some functionality to the color sliders so that the hue, brightness and saturation can be used to update the current color in the relevant palette position.

**Thoughts**

-   Text Contrast: The luminance of a color is calculated using the Chroma JS library, the luminance can range from 0 (darkest) to 1 (brightest). If the luminance is above 0.5, the hex text of the color is updated to black, otherwise white, to prevent the text disappearing into the color.

-   Initalizing Sliders: When the page loads, the color sliders are updated in accordance with the current color. There are 3 sliders to for each color, hue, brightness and saturation. The hue slider contains a background set using a range of RGB values to create the hue effect. For brightness, it ranges from dark, to half the current colors luminance, to complete white. Using the Chroma JS set() function allows you to create variations of the current color by updating it's luminance/brightness. The Chroma JS scale() function and passing an array of color variations results in a color function, 0 being the leftmost value of the scale array, to 1, the rightmost value of the scale. Apply this scale to a linear-gradient allows the background of a slider to be more informative to the user. The saturation slider works the same.

-   Make Sliders Update Color: An event listener was added to each slider to check for any input adjustments. If a change happened using a slider, the event would grab the relevant color and update it using the current hue, brightness and saturation values.

-   Update Hex Text and Icon Colors: This needs not only to happen when the page loads, but also update the contrast of the text and icons relevant to a color so that they can always remain seen.

-   Currently a bug exists when using the sliders. Once a slider updates, the sliders work in accordance to the new color, not the color it first generated. Since we only want to modify the original color, it must be kept in reference and used over and over again.

### Day 61: June 17, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Continuing with the Coolors project, fixed the bug mentioned yesterday in relation to update a color. The slider brightness and saturation positions are set and updated in relation to current color. Copy color hex code to clipboard function. Implement slider toggle logic.

**Thoughts**

-   Fixing the bug mentioned yesterday included keeping reference to the original generated color, since that is what is being toggled by the sliders, not the resulting color of the slider changes.

-   Using the Chroma JS library, the brightness and saturation of a color can be calculated very easily. This was used to set the value of the slider positions for each color which is generated.

-   Copying the color hex code to the clipboard required a hack which involves creating a text area element and appending it to the page. The value of the text area is set and then selected before executing the copy command on the document.

-   The sliders were updated to be hidden when the page loads, to use them they must be toggled using the adjustment menu button. This will show the sliders and they can be hidden again by clicking the adjustment button or the X button.

### Day 62: June 18, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Finished up the Coolors project! Many new features added including contrast checks when generating a new palette. Toggling a colors lock button will cause it to not change when generating a new palette. The save button can be used to save a palette to local storage. The library button can be used to view dynaically generated elements containing palette information. In reality, this project is the largest javascript project I've completed so far, the most difficult things include navigating the lengthy JS file and the abundant amount of element selections really confuses things. At a later date, I will begin looking into libraries which can aid in this. Another difficult thing is dealing with indexes, it can be overwhelming but stresses the importance of knowing the type of data you are dealing with, e.g. What elements you are selected and what their parent/child data are.

**Thoughts**
A lot of progress made today, finishing it up took many hours of work. Following Ed's videos only helped to a certain extent, I'm not sure if he intentionally left out some areas of work or not but they had to be done, which was great practice. I noticed a few areas where what he was doing could be improved, A LOT, so I implemented almost half the logic just using my own agreeable process.

-   Clicking the generate button will refresh the palette and the color control buttons also needed to be updated. Nothing difficult here as reused existing logic, just added an event listener to the generate button.

-   Toggling the lock button will stop a color from regenerating. This is achieved by toggling a class called "locked" on the relevant color. A simple check is performed and any locked colors are re-added to the palette during the regeneration process.

-   Clicking the save button will present a popup where an input field is filled with a palette name. The name along with the current palette colors are then set as property values of an object. This object is stored in the browser local storage.

-   The library button will present a popup of dynamically generated html. When a palette is saved, it is retrieved from local storage and added to the list of saved palettes in the library. The html elements and classes are generated within javascript.

-   Within the library, a color can be chosen and will update the current color palette to the chosen saved palette. This is a lengthy process but I aimed to reuse as much code as possible, e.g. checking contrast, colorizing sliders and updating slider values. Originally the code consisted of both storing the saved color palettes in local storage but also in an array in code, this confused things so I opted to only use local storage.

### Day 63: June 19, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Began working on the next project which is a website focused on interactivity and animations using additional JS libraries. Currently have the HTML created and the pages initial styling done.

**Thoughts**
Today was more of a messing around and learning random things day. There were a number of num CSS properties I was introduced to today as well as a JavaScript library called ScrollMagic which simplifies the process of creating scroll events.

-   flex-basis: this property sets the initial length of a flex(ible) item. If flex-direction is set to row, then the flex-basis controls the width, if flex-direction is set to column, flex-basis controls the height. To control the latter (height of row & width of column), the width and height properties must be set. There are a number of flex container properties set by default (listed below), one being flex-shrink. Since flex items are allowed to shrink by default, the flex-basis/width/height properties may be overridden. Read more [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34352140/what-are-the-differences-between-flex-basis-and-width)

1. flex-direction: row - flex items will align horizontally
2. justify-content: flex-start - flex items will stack at the start of the line on the main axis
3. align-items: stretch - flex items will expand to cover the cross-size of the container
4. flex-wrap: nowrap - flex items are forced to stay in a single line
5. flex-shrink: 1 - a flex item is allowed to shrink

-   Spent some time playing with the ScrollMagic library: In the past scroll effects were controlled using the window scroll event, this presented a number of issues such as sluggishness as the function would be hundreds of times a minute. An alternative is to use the Intersection Observer API which asynchronously observers changes at an intersection of a target element with an ancestor element, the window by default. Creating this IO object takes two arguments, a function: which is called when this intersection occurs and options: which defines info such as the threshold and the ancestor element. The object is then used to observer an element or elements. This API becomes difficult to use as having complex animations is not as simple as creating observers. ScrollMagic allows the creation of complex animations while also visually tracking/debugging animations on the page during development.

**NB**
I will be taking a break from Ed's Course from now until I have other important work done.

### Day 67: June 30, 2020

Resource: YouTube [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsEMyKrlnw&list=WL&index=2&t=0s)

**Todays Progress**: AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) Information - Yet to put into practice, awaiting AWS account activation (24 hours).

**Thoughts**
Topics Covered:

-   Quick Overview of AWS Storage Services: Elastic Block Store, Elastic File System, S3 Glacier, Storage Gateway

-   S3 provides a web interface through which any amount of data can be stored and retrieved at any time, from anywhere on the web and quickly.

-   S3 stores object data in buckets. Buckets can be created in any available region. An objects contains a storage class property which determines how a file is stored. The most common storage classes are Standard, Infrequent Access and Glacier. A files lifecycle can be configured to change its storage class or file experation.

-   Versioning can be enabled to keep a reference to older versions of a file. This keeps S3 durable by ensuring any change, whether accidental or intentional never results in a file being completely lost. Older version of files can be referenced by their Version ID.

-   S3 is also made durable using CRR (Cross Region Replication). This allows you to move data from one bucket to another bucket in a different region. If one region has an outage, your file may be accessed from another region, although it may be at a slightly slower rate.

-   S3 Transfer Accerleration is used to ensure data is accessible quickly from regions outside of your own. This works in conjuction with AWS CloudFront which caches your data at an Edge Location, this location allows your data to be retrieved quicker as it will be closer to your current region. The Edge Location has an optimized network path between itself and the S3 Bucket.

-   Access Policies allow your data to remain secure by only allowing certain actions to be performed within your Bucket.

### Day 68: July 1, 2020

Resource: YouTube [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TlukLu11Yo)

**Todays Progress**: AWS EC2 overview and configuration. Also hosted an Express API on an instance.

**Thoughts**
Topics Covered:

-   EC2 is a secure and scalable compute capacity in the cloud with many advantages such as not needing to invest in physical hardware, only paying for the compute you use and being able to work from anywhere in the world.

-   There are a number of steps involved in setting up an EC2 Instance:

```
Choosing an AMI - the template used to create a new instance which will include os, software, volume and access information.
Chose an Instance Type - the hardware specs used for the machine, different instances are optimized for different usage requirements.
Configure Instance - this includes the number of instances, purchasing options, IAM role, startup and shutdown behaviour etc.
Adding Storage - can be a standard SSD volume or integrate with other AWS services such as EBS and S3.
Adding Tags - used in identifying the machine if manny instances exist.
Configure Security Group - controlling the access of inbound and outbound traffic. e.g. exposing HTTP or custom TCP ports.
Review Configuration - ensure instance is configured correctly for the required use case.
```

-   On Windows, use PuTTY to SSH into the instance, or on Linux use a .pem file along with the SSH command to emulate the instance terminal.

-   SSH is a protocol for operating network services securely, in this case, executing commands within the instance, remotely.
