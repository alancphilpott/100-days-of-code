### Day 11 to 22 Microverse

[About](https://www.microverse.org/) Microverse
I was successful in the Microverse application process and became a student for 2 weeks. My goal was to improve my collaboration and peer-programming skills. After 2 weeks in I realised that the course was not for me and I could also feel that Microverse was still in its early stages with cracks yet to be ironed out. I provided useful feedback to the company and parted ways. Still met some great people.

### Day 24 Beginners Guide to Docker

View Guide [Here](https://www.learncloudnative.com/blog/2020-04-29-beginners-guide-to-docker/#pull-and-run)

I came across a post on Twitter by [pjausovec](https://twitter.com/pjausovec) asking for feedback on a recent blog post of his in relation to Docker. Having not worked with Docker in over 2 years I wanted to revise the basics and this blog helped a lot.

## Daily Log Update Begins Here

### Day 50: June 5, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Began creating a todo app, finished its layout and can create todos.

**Thoughts**

-   Introduced to the DOM for the first time. Nothing too complicated, yet.
-   Differece between a HTML Collection and NodeList when obtaining HTML elements through JS.
-   How to create Events and handle Event Bubbling.
-   Dynamically add HTML elements using JS.
-   Working with Google Fonts API and Font Awesome Icons.
-   Using Emmet Shortcuts

**Useful Resources**

### Day 51: June 6, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Continuing todo app, added complete and delete todo functionality.

**Thoughts**

-   Learnt how to toggle CSS classes from within JavaScript.
-   Improving at working with Parent-Child elements in JS.
-   Creating animation effects when an event occurs.
-   Working with and styling the select HTML elememt.
-   Realisation that CSS class naming is important to prevent errors.

### Day 52: June 7, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Completed todo app. Fixed filtering todos errors. Todos now save to the browsers local storage. Added favicon. Project hosted using GitHub Pages service (see link to work below).

**Thoughts**

-   Difference between local and session storage.
-   Used stackoverflow to find out a CSS property related to Mozilla called "-moz-focusring".
-   Deleting items from local storage can be tricky. Used alternative method than suggested from the course called Arrray.filter().

There is definitely more work that can be done to this app such as when refreshing the page, the todos marked as completed, stay marked as completed. That would require some manipulation of the data when saving to the browsers local storage. Will come back to this at a later date.

### Day 53: June 8, 2020

eCollege JavaScript [Course](https://www.fetchcourses.ie/course/finder?sfcw-courseId=228121)

**Todays Progress**: Continuing with the eCollege JavaScript course requires me to go back over a lot of the basics as the later parts of the course are not accessible until they are complete. Nothing challenging today.

**Thoughts**

The course consists of 5 topics to cover. Each topic requiring about 2 weeks of study for someone new to programming. I finished the first topic today and noted the most important areas for this topic. Topic 1 teaches Operators, Methods and Keywords.

-   Be aware of the reserve keywords, e.g. Document, Debugger, Finally, Try, Console, Window, Catch, Log, Screen.
-   Know the symbols for basic math, especially the modulas operator. It can have it's own entier exam topic.
-   How to use compound assignment operators.
-   Increment and Decremenet prefix and postfix.
-   Best practices: comments, indentations, naming conventions, debugging tools.
-   Using inline and external scripts, including precendence rules.
-   Try, Catch and Finally.
-   Differences between alert, confirm, and prompty dialogs.
-   How to retrieve screen size, important for responsive design.

### Day 54: June 9, 2020

**Todays Progress**: Started working on Chapter 4 of Ed's Creative JavaScript course. This chapter focuses on working with Arrays, of which I am very familiar with already, but getting a unique perspective based on his teaching methods is still a valuable case.

**Thoughts**

I made it through 7/10 topics with Chapter 4: Arrays. The areas covered were:

-   Primitives and Reference Data Types - great refresher on something easily overlooked by programmers.
-   Higher Order Functions and Callbacks - very valuable information, especially since JS is highly event-driven.
-   Array.map()
-   Array.find()
-   Array.filter()
-   Array.some() and Array.every() - was my first time using these methods, will definitely use in future.
-   Ternary Operator - the only conditional operator to have 3 operands and something no developer can do without.

I am committing this work to GitHub but to a private repository.

### Skipped June 10, 2020 - Too unwell.

### Day 55: June 11, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Finished of Chatper 4 of Ed's Creative JavaScript Course.

**Thoughts**

I made it through the final 3 topics of Chapter 4: Arrays. The areas covered were:

-   Arrow Functions: a great compact alternative to regular function expressions. If the function has one statement within it, the curly brackets can be removed and the statement result is automatically returned.
-   Array Sorting: Calling sort() without any arguments will sort Strings, but to sort Numbers, the optional compareFunction arguments can be passed in, sort(firstEl, secondEl).
-   Spread Syntax: Something I'd seen before maybe once or twice, used to create a clone of Arrays/Objects which as a result will not affect the original reference data.

I am committing this work to GitHub but to a private repository.

### Day 56: June 12, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Finished of Chatper 5 of Ed's Creative JavaScript Course. This chapter was on Objects and covered many important topics.

**Thoughts**
Having a larger exposure to Java for the last number of years, the topic of Objects was nothing new to me, but within JavaScript there is a number of ways to create Objects.

-   Global Execution Context: Quick look into the compilation and execution phase. The compilation phase creates the default objects such as window in the browser and global within Node. Hoisting is also performed here, where functions and var declarations are stored in memory.
-   Callstack: The compile phase creates the Scope Chain determining what is accessible and where. When a function is called, a new execution context is created and added to the callstack. Once the function finishes executing, it is popped from the callstack and the execution context continues.
-   This Keyword: A pointer which references an object. This will be the window/global object by default. Using inside of an object method will reference the object itself.
-   Bind, Call, Apply: Functions are a type of Object. Allows setting of the this keyword to reference any object.
-   Constructor Functions: Used to instatiate an object using optional parameters.
-   Prototype: An object which every new object references. Used to add methods to an object to prevent duping of logic within each instance of an object.
-   Prototypal Inheritance: Copying/Inheriting functionality from another constructor. Allows creation of more specific types of an object.
-   Classes: Blueprints used for the creation of objects.

I am committing this work to GitHub but to a private repository.

### Day 57: June 13, 2020

Resource: developedbyed Creative JavaScript [Course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)

**Todays Progress**: Finished the beatmaker project of Ed's Creative JavaScript Course.

**Thoughts**
I coded along with the tutorial videos but tomorrow I will add some more beats and functionality to the app to solidify my understanding of its creation. During this process I am sure to come up with another app I could create using similar knowledge.

-   Defining a class and creating an object.
-   Adding methods to the object to update/control props.
-   Functionality includes: selecting "pads" to play sounds on, choosing different sounds, play and pause feature, mute tracks and tempo slider.
